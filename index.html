    <h1>Story Of My Daily Life</h2>
    <p>Hi Im Ria im twenty one years old im from indonesia. <br>Im working in hotel located in heart of city of <i>Istanbul.</i> <br>I`ve been live in Istanbul almost two years, In my free time i like to spend my time for studying own my own,<br>most of the time i like to listening one of my favorite music from ADELE`S song.</p>
    <h3>One of my favorite song:<br>ADELE - Set fire to the rain</h3>
    <pre>
        <h3>lyrics:</h3>
        <p>
            All the things you'd say
            All the things you'd say
            All the things you'd say
            I let it fall, my heart
            And as it fell, you rose to claim it
            It was dark and I was over
            Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
            My hands, they're strong
            But my knees were far too weak
            To stand in your arms
            Without falling to your feet 
            But there's a side to you
            That I never knew, never knew
            All the things you'd say
            They were never true, never true
            And the games you play
            You would always win, always win
            <b>But I set fire to the rain</b>
            Watched it pour as I touched your face
            Well, it burned while I cried
            'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
            Your name
            <b>But I set fire to the rain</b>
            Watched it pour as I touched your face
            Well, it burned while I cried
            'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
            Your name
            All the things you'd say
            But I set fire
            All the things you'd say
            All the things you'd say</p>
